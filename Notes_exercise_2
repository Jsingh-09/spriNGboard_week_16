Notes for Exercise 2: Python Environment

-- When the command python --version is ran it input "python" command not found.
   The container shows the ouput based on what is installed on that specific 
   containter. The python version listed were python 3.6.15 and python 3.10.9 .
   Those results were expected since those version were installed in the previous
   exercise.

-- Setting the environment for Project A was based on first creating a virtual 
   environment for project A and then setting the environment using the command
   pyenv local project_a_env. When the command python --version is ran inside 
   project_a it inputs "Python 3.10.9"

-- Moving back a directory shows the same input, where it shows the list of the 
   versions where the python command exitsts rather than shows the exact version
   like the previous directory inside project_a.
