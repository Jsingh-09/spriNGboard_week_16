Notes for Exercise 5: Thread and Process and Pools in Python

-- While watching the video and testing the code on my end I was running into the 
   error mentioned in the instruction where it was complaining about Attribute error
   about threading. The reason for the error is because the python file is named as 
   threading where threading is one of the library within python. Renaming the file 
   would resolve the issue.

-- The reason the code might run slower on my end compare to the one in the video
   is because of the available cores difference between the two different machines.
   More available cores can lead to faster execution compare to being slower when
   cores are taken.
