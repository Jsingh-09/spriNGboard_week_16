Notes for Exercise 6

-- By uncommenting line A it took around 1.01 seconds. The do_something function
   has a sleep duration of one second and it does not have any complex tasks within
   the function and it takes 1 second to run concurrently and prints the output.
 
-- While uncommenting line B it took around 9.56 seconds. The do_something_hard 
   function does involve more complex code compare to do_something. Do_something_hard
   function does have two nexted for loops and does have complex task to perform 
   and which results the function to take around 9ish seconds to output.

-- Changing from ThreadPoolExecutor to ProcessPoolExecutor the only difference was
   seen in the do_something_hard function where it took around 4.01 seconds compare
   to 9.56 seconds when using threadPoolExecutor. ProcessPoolExecutor seem to be 
   faster running complex task compare to threadpoolExecutor. Process can execute 
   parallel which can save time and cores at the same part which thread are ran 
   concurrently using more cores and time.
